**Equation Discovery and Symbolic Regression Toolkit**
--------------------------------------------------------

This repository provides a Python-based toolkit for equation discovery and symbolic regression. The toolkit includes tools for parameter estimation and performance evaluation, enabling users to discover and analyze mathematical relationships in data.

**Overview**
------------

The toolkit is designed to facilitate the discovery of mathematical equations that describe complex relationships in data. It uses a combination of symbolic regression and parameter estimation techniques to identify the underlying equations.

**Features**
------------

* Parameter estimation for equation discovery
* Performance evaluation for symbolic regression models
* Support for various equation forms and libraries

**Requirements**
---------------

* Python 3.11
* NumPy
* SciPy

**Usage**
---------

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The toolkit is organized into several modules, each with its own documentation and examples.

* `PESR`: Parameter Estimator and Performance Evaluator for Symbolic Regression
* `examples`: Example use cases and tutorials

**Contributing**
------------
