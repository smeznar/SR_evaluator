**Symbolic Regression/Equation Discovery Toolkit**
--------------------------------------------------------

This repository provides a Python-based toolkit for equation discovery/symbolic regression. Currently, the toolkit contains
code for transforming infix expressions into trees, parameter estimation, and performance evaluation for symbolic regression models.

Currently, we only support (vanilla) mathematical expressions, however, we provide a simple interface for adding custom symbols.
In the future, we might extend our functionality to support more advanced expressions (differential equations, PDEs, ...).

A simple example of how to use the toolkit can be found in the `examples` folder, mainly the `examples/SR_evaluation` script.
